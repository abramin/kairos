# Code Review Skill
1. Analyze the specified area (frontend/backend) for issues
2. Present findings in a numbered list with severity
3. Wait for user approval before implementing fixes
4. After fixes: verify build passes, run all tests, grep for stale imports/references
5. Check that API response serialization matches any domain model changes
